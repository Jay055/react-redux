1. semantic ui cdn
2. faker js for random libary files 
3. use npm install -- save faker 
from the readme you can use the faker.image.avatar(), you call like a function 
4. Reusable components 
Identify the reusable / duplicated JSX
Identify a name and new file. (Comment detail)

Components: 
If we want to show components we show it as a tag 

App Parent Component 
Comment Detail Child Components 

Props 
Sysytem for passing data from a parent component to a child component.

Goal is to customize or configure a child component.
A child cannot pass data to a parent with the props.
<CommentDetail author= {author} />

props are passed in as an argument in a function.

  <CommentDetail  author="Mike" />
   console.log(props): {author: "Mike"}.

    {props.author}. Include all your properties as props.

    Wrap in a Card. 

You can get the card type from semantic UI.
https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html


props.children


Once you put children inside a component you can access the properties by     
/props.children/
<ApprovalCard>
      <CommentDetail author="John" timeAgo="Today at 5:46PM" text="Basic B" img={faker.image.avatar()} />
</ApprovalCard>
